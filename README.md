# Building a Neural Network: A One-Week Course

Welcome! This repository contains all the materials for a one-week intensive course on understanding and building a neural network. This project is designed for students with a foundational knowledge of Python who are ready to dive into the exciting world of machine learning.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

* Understand the core concepts behind neural networks (neurons, layers, activation functions, backpropagation).
* Preprocess and prepare data for a machine learning model using Pandas.
* Build a simple neural network from scratch using Python.
* Train and evaluate your model's performance.
* Gain practical experience using Git for version control in a project setting.

## üí° What You'll Need

* **Required:** A basic understanding of **Python**. You should be comfortable with its fundamental syntax, data structures (like lists and dictionaries), and how to write functions.
* **Provided:** This course includes introductory sessions on **Pandas** for data handling and **Git** for version control. No prior experience with these tools is necessary!

## üóìÔ∏è Weekly Schedule

This course is structured to guide you through the process step-by-step.

* **Day 1: Foundations & Data Prep**
    * Introduction to Neural Networks (Theory).
    * Setting up your development environment.
    * Intro to Git & Cloning this repository.
    * Intro to Pandas for Data Analysis.
    * **Task:** Data exploration and preprocessing with Pandas.

* **Day 2: Building the Components**
    * Understanding the structure of a neuron and a layer.
    * Introduction to activation functions.
    * **Task:** Code the `Neuron` and `Layer` classes in Python.

* **Day 3: Assembling the Network**
    * Connecting layers to form a network.
    * Implementing the forward pass (making predictions).
    * **Task:** Code the `NeuralNetwork` class and the `feedforward` method.

* **Day 4: Training the Network**
    * Introduction to loss functions and backpropagation (the learning part!).
    * **Task:** Implement the `backpropagate` and `train` methods.

* **Day 5: Evaluation & Wrap-up**
    * Putting it all together: training and testing your network on real data.
    * Evaluating your model's accuracy.
    * **Task:** Run the full experiment, analyze your results, and make final commits.

## üöÄ How to Use This Repository

1.  **Clone the Repository:** Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone [URL_of_this_repository]
    ```

2.  **Follow the Daily Structure:** Each day's tasks and resources will be located in correspondingly named folders (e.g., `Day1_DataPrep`, `Day2_Components`).

3.  **Work on the Tasks:** Complete the coding exercises and tasks outlined for each day.

4.  **Commit Your Progress:** Use Git to commit your changes regularly. This is great practice and helps you track your work.
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Completed Day 1 data preprocessing"
    ```

5.  **Ask Questions:** Don't hesitate to ask questions! Machine learning can be challenging, and we're here to help.

We're excited to have you with us for the week. Let's build something amazing!
