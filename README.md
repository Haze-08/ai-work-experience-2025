# Building a Neural Network: A One-Week Course

Welcome to STFC Hartree Centre! We hope you enjoy your week of work experience with the AI Group. You'll find a [Schedule](Schedule.pdf) for the week here too to give you an idea of what to expect. This repository also contains all the materials you'll need.


## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

* Understand the core concepts behind neural networks (neurons, layers, activation functions, backpropagation).
* Preprocess and prepare data for a machine learning model using Pandas.
* Build a simple neural network from scratch and using Python libraries.
* Train and evaluate your model's performance.
* Gain practical experience using Git for version control in a project setting.

## üöÄ Getting Started: Setting Up Your Workspace

Before we begin, you need to create your own copy of this project. This will give you a personal workspace where you can save your code and track your progress.

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Account
If you don't already have one, you'll need to create a free GitHub account. This is an essential tool for software developers.

1.  Go to [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join).
2.  Follow the instructions to sign up.

### Step 2: Fork This Repository
"Forking" creates a personal copy of this entire project in your own GitHub account.

1.  Make sure you are logged into your GitHub account.
2.  Click the **"Fork"** button in the top-right corner of this page.
3.  GitHub will create a copy of the repository under your username. You'll be automatically taken there.

### Step 3: Clone Your Forked Repository
Now, you need to get the files onto your computer. This is called "cloning".

1.  On your forked repository page on GitHub, click the green **"<> Code"** button.
2.  Make sure the "HTTPS" tab is selected, and copy the URL.
3.  Open a terminal or command prompt on your computer and run the following command (paste the URL you just copied):
    ```bash
    git clone [URL_YOU_COPIED_FROM_YOUR_FORK]
    ```
4.  This will create a folder on your computer with all the project files. You're all set up!

**Remember to commit your progress:** Use Git to commit your changes regularly. This is great practice and helps you track your work.
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Completed Day 1 data preprocessing"
    ```

## üí° What You'll Need

* **Required:** A basic understanding of **Python**. You should be comfortable with its fundamental syntax, data structures (like lists and dictionaries), and how to write functions. We (and Google) are always here to help with anything you might get stuck with. 

* **Provided:** We'll also give you an introduction to a library called **Pandas** for data handling and **Git** for version control. No prior experience with these tools is necessary, though you might already have some!

## üóìÔ∏è Workflow

* **Task 0: Downloading / installing what you need**
  

* **Task 1: Pandas**

* **Task 2: Git?**
    * Connecting layers to form a network.
    * Implementing the forward pass (making predictions).
    * **Task:** Code the `NeuralNetwork` class and the `feedforward` method.

* **Day 4: Training the Network**
    * Introduction to loss functions and backpropagation (the learning part!).
    * **Task:** Implement the `backpropagate` and `train` methods.

* **Day 5: Evaluation & Wrap-up**
    * Putting it all together: training and testing your network on real data.
    * Evaluating your model's accuracy.
    * **Task:** Run the full experiment, analyze your results, and make final commits.


5.  **Ask Questions:** Don't hesitate to ask questions! Machine learning can be challenging, and we're here to help.

We're excited to have you with us for the week. Let's build something amazing!
